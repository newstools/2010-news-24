Bongani HansAVERAGE speed over distance cameras installed on the N3 have proven to be a success with the prosecution of more than 31&thinsp;000 speedsters over the last three months.The project was launched as a pilot project in 2008.Two sets of cameras have been installed on both sides of the N3 between Nottingham Road and Balgowan to capture speeding motorists.The cameras, which are popular in Europe, measure the time a vehicle takes to cover the 8,5&thinsp;km between the two cameras in a 100&thinsp;km/h zone.The director of the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI), John Schnell, said the project has proven to be a success.&ldquo;According to our monthly report on these cameras&rsquo; operation, there are many motorists who have been caught &hellip;&ldquo;This has brought down the number of accidents happening on the N3.&ldquo;The more people are aware of these cameras the more they reduce speed,&rdquo; Schnell said, without giving statisticsAccording to an RTI graph, the number of speed offenders went down from 700 to fewer than 100 between July 1 and July 29.RTI spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu said the fewer offenders proves the project is working very well.Schnell said that although the cameras can be legally challenged, they were installed with the blessing of the director of public prosecutions.&ldquo;We would proudly state that as we did our homework the average speed over distance project can stand the test of a legal challenge,&rdquo; he said.He said there are signs to warn motorists when they are about to approach the cameras and that the RTI is planning to introduce the cameras at other points along the N3.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
