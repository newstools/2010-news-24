Witness Reporter AN Estcourt driver has expressed outrage after he alleges he was overtaken on the N3 by a speeding Roadlink bus, which cut him off then sped away so fast that the driver could not keep up. The driver, who captured the speeding bus on his camera phone on Tuesday starting at 2.23pm, asked not to be named. He told The Witness he was driving from Estcourt to Pietermaritzburg and as he passed the Nottingham Road turn-off, the SA Roadlink bus came up behind him. “I was doing just under 120 km when the bus came speeding up. It was behind a BMW in the fast lane and the BMW eventually pulled over to let the bus driver pass. He was going so fast that at first I thought his brakes had failed. The bus went whizzing past the BMW and my car, and when I realised there was nothing wrong with the brakes, I decided to chase it and film it on my phone.” The man said he immediately began pursuing the bus, at times doing almost 160 km/h to catch up. The video shows clips of the bus, a road sign warning drivers to drive at 100 km/h on that stretch and the man’s speedometer. “The bus was full of passengers. It was really unsafe. The driver was flying — speeding and overtaking without indicating.” He said he caught up with the bus after a slower car held it up in the fast lane. At one point he alleges that the bus was unable to take a corner at the speed it was doing in the fast lane and careened across the centre line, cutting him off. The horrified man said he eventually had to give up the chase as his car simply could not keep up. Colin Govender of the Transport Department said motorists who witness reckless driving should report it to the police at 10111 or to the department’s toll-free number on 0800 339911. “If the driver had called us with the numberplate of the vehicle, and agreed to give evidence, we could have caught the driver.”    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
