Julian RademeyerJOHANNESBURG &mdash; An upset Dirk Prinsloo was removed from the court yesterday after five hours of testimony in his trial in Belarus, when the judge lost his temper with the South African.Judge Vasiliy Petriv was not impressed with the alleged child sex criminal&rsquo;s repeated outbursts and &ldquo;irrelevant questions&rdquo;.Prinsloo is facing several charges of assault, torture, theft, thuggery and attempted bank robbery.Petriv found that Prinsloo was &ldquo;systematically disrupting the court proceedings&rdquo; and that he repeatedly made himself guilty of contempt of court.Prinsloo may not appear in the Baranovichi district court again until all witnesses and &ldquo;victims&rdquo; have finished testifying, ordered Petriv.A shocked Prinsloo was cuffed by police officials and taken away.The whole drama happened while testimony was being delivered about Prinsloo&rsquo;s alleged involvement in a failed bank robbery in Baranovichi on June 10 last year.Prinsloo was caught two days later in an Internet cafe in Minsk, the Belarusian capital.Some of the cashiers who were present when Prinsloo stormed into the bank with a toy gun, a bala&shy;clava and a knife, cried while they testified yesterday.Prinsloo apologised for his behaviour to one of the women who was assaulted during the attempted robbery.However, his repeated interruptions while Petriv was questioning the witnesses, led to his removal from the court room.Earlier the court heard how Prinsloo allegedly regularly assaulted one of his former mistresses, Anastasia Gomza, between June and December 2008. In one instance her nose was broken and her lips cut.&ldquo;I took his threats seriously,&rdquo; Gom&shy;za testified, according to the Pretoria News.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that, if he gets out of jail, I won&rsquo;t live for very long. He said he&rsquo;ll make my face ugly and cut my body until I die. He also said he will kill my whole family. I took the threats seriously because he killed my dog.&rdquo;Dirk made her his &ldquo;slave&rdquo; and he was her &ldquo;god&rdquo;, she testified.Gomza apparently met Prinsloo in a cafe in Minsk in April 2008. He introduced himself as &ldquo;Michael Grant&rdquo; &mdash; a businessman from Australia. She said she only knew him as Grant.But Prinsloo denied her allegations, and according to the newspaper, he said Gomza had his real name tattooed on her body, and also used his photo on the Interpol website to have his face tattooed on her stomach.He also said the wounds seen in the photos he took of her were made with beetroot juice, since Gomza wanted to make a &ldquo;vampire music album&rdquo;.They made several videos and took photos while they were having sex, he said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
