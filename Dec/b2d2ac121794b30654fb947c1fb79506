Bongani HansTWENTY commuters travelling to celebrate Christmas with their families were killed in a head-on collision between the two minibus taxis they were travelling in on the N2 in northern KwaZulu-Natal yesterday morning.KwaZulu-Natal Transport Department head Chris Hlabisa, who went to the scene, said the accident was the result of a lack of patience and reckless overtaking.The accident involved a taxi, which was travelling from Durban to Mozambique, and another one travelling from Jozini to Empangeni.Paramedics arrived at the scene to find that 16 of the victims were dead at the scene, while four more people died on arrival at Ngwelezane Hospital. The accident happened at about 10 am.Hlabisa said police established from the survivors that the driver travelling to Empangeni had tried to overtake another vehicle when he collided with the taxi en route to Mozambique, whose driver also died.&ldquo;This was clearly out of intolerance and bad judgment. That road is straight and neat ... &rdquo; said Hlabisa. He said the deceased on the scene were all adults.Three children, believed to be between the ages of three and four years, suffered serious injury. He was not sure whether any of the children had died at the hospital.He said police were busy matching identity documents to the bodies in order to inform family members here and in Mozambique. The survivors would also be asked to establish who was going where &ldquo;because the bodies were just scattered on the road while others were trapped,&rdquo; said Hlabisa.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
